    Hello, my name is Gaurav Pant. I graduated with a diploma in Mechanical Engineering from Uttarakhand Institute Of Technical And Professional Education in 2019. Following my graduation, I embarked on a journey in the professional world by joining Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd., where I served as a Quality Controller in the automobile sector. However, due to the unforeseen circumstances brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I had to bid farewell to my role at Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd.

    In the face of change, I transitioned to OnGrid, a Background Verification Company, where I took on the role of an Operation Analyst. Despite my contributions, I realized my passion lay in more technical domains. Hence, in 2021, I decided to pursue a degree in Information Technology from Radha Govind College of Education, currently in its final semester. During my academic journey, I recognized the importance of programming skills, prompting me to delve into Java, MySQL Databases, MongoDB Databases, and Spring Boot Framework.

    Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I find solace and joy in indulging in hobbies such as playing card games, board games, sketching, and listening to music. These activities not only offer me relaxation but also stimulate my creativity.

    With a diverse background spanning mechanical engineering, quality control, operations analysis, and now information technology, coupled with my eagerness to continuously learn and adapt, I am enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead in leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully in a technical role.
